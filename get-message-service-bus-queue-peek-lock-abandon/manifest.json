    "title": "Azure Service Bus: Get message from a queue - Peek lock abandon pattern",
    "description": "This workflow template triggers when a message is available in a Service Bus queue. The workflow gets the message from the queue and locks the message for processing. The message is deleted from the queue after processing completes. This pattern helps you make sure that the workflow processes the message only once and that the message doesn't get lost if a failure happens during processing.",
