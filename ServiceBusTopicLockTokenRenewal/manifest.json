    "title": "Service Bus Peek Lock Pattern - get message from a topic subscription with token renewal",
    "description": "Get new message from a Service Bus topic subscription and lock it for processing, renewing the lock token until processing is completed. The message will be deleted from the topic subscription after the processing is completed. This pattern is useful when you want to ensure that the message is processed only once and not lost in case of a failure during processing.",
