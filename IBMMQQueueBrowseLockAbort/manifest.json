    "description": "Get new message from a IBM MQ queue and lock it for processing. The message will be deleted from the queue after the processing is completed. This pattern is useful when you want to ensure that the message is processed only once and not lost in case of a failure during processing. For more information about using this connector, see [Connect to an IBM MQ server from a workflow in Azure Logic Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/connectors/connectors-create-api-mq)",
    "prerequisites": "Before you can use this template, you need to use the state preservation feature and enable VNET integration.
