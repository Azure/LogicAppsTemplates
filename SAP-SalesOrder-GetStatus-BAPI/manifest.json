You will also need connection details for your SAP system and a RFC user. To reach a private SAP on Azure system use [VNet integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/secure-single-tenant-workflow-virtual-network-private-endpoint#set-up-outbound-traffic-using-virtual-network-integration). For on-premise adapt the BAPI configuration to use the [On-premises Data Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/install-on-premises-data-gateway)",
