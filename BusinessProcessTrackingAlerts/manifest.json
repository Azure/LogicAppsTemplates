    "description": "The Business Process Tracking Alerts template allows you to detect Business Process Tracking stages that have failed so that you can notify key business stakeholders using Microsoft Teams.",
    "prerequisites": "To use this template, you should have an existing Business Process deployed that is emitting data to an Azure Data Explorer (ADX) instance. This workflow will query a defined ADX instance and issue queries against that database and subsequently surface the business process details. Note: To use this template, there are some pre-requisites that need to be addressed. You will also need an Azure Storage Account that includes a table, with the name of your choice, that includes a field called 'LastAlertedProcessed'. You will also find some development artifacts which can be retrieved from our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Azure/LogicAppsTemplates/tree/main/BusinessProcessTrackingAlerts). Within this folder, you will find 2 schemas, an XSLT map and the LML file. You will need to upload XSLT file to the Artifacts/Maps folder in your Logic App. You can achieve this through Azure Portal. The other artifacts are for your reference in the case you want to make changes to the data transformation. To learn more about Busness Process Tracking, please see our documentation.
