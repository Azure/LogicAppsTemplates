    "description": "This workflow is for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern for data indexing and retrieval. This has two workflows - \n- The indexing workflow reads documents from SharePoint whenever a new file is added or updated. The workflow then parses, chunks, generates embeddings, and loads those embeddings into AI Search vector store. \n- The retrieval workflow uses the AI Search connector to retrieve vectors and then uses Azure OpenAI LLMs to reason on the data.",
