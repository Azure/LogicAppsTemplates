This pattern is useful when you want to ensure that the message is processed only once and not lost in case of a failure during processing.",
    "prerequisites": "Before you can use this template, you need to configure a Service Bus namespace and create a queue. For more information about Service Bus see [Create a new queue on Service Bus](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-quickstart-portal)",
