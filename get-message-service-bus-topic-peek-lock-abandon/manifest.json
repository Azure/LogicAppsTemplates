    "description": "This workflow template triggers when a message is available in a Service Bus topic subscription. The workflow gets the message from the topic subscription and locks the message for processing. The message is deleted from the topic subscription after processing completes. This pattern helps you make sure that the workflow processes the message only once and that the message doesn't get lost if a failure happens during processing.",
